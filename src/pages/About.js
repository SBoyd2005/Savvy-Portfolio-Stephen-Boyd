            I am a disciplined young man, defined through diverse personal and professional experience. I
            strive
            to constantly improve my mind, body, and soul each day. I have a Midwestern work ethic with a
            California heart and soul.
            In my spare time, I enjoy exercising, particulary running and weight lifting. I love to challenge
            myself and want to do a half-marathon and full marathon soon! In addition, I am a world-traveler
            and my favorite city in the United States to visit is San Francisco. I love watching sports and I
            am an avid fan of the Saint Louis Blues, Saint Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants, and Green Bay
            Packers. I am very eclectic with my music taste and have seen Metallica, Paul McCartney, Garth
            Brooks, the Beach Boys, Journey, and Def Leppard in concert.
